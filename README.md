    - Fill the domain section with your domain name, like `devopstest.elasticsuite.com`.
    - Navigate to the dropdown menu under the Type section.
    - Put the type SSH with port 22 in the section like `localhost:22`.
    - Save the tunnel.

## Tunnel Access Through Native Terminal

1. Install `cloudflared` by using the following commands in your client machine:

```
curl -L --output cloudflared.deb https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb &&  
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
   ```
![img_18.png](assets/img_18.png)

2. After successful installation of `cloudflared`, put the below command in your client machine to open the SSH config
   file with vim editor:

```
vim ~/.ssh/config
   ```
![img_19.png](assets/img_19.png)

3. Put the following commands in the client machine in the SSH config file and save the file:

```
Host ssh.devopstest.elasticsuite.com
ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/cloudflared access ssh â€“hostname %h
   ```
![img_20.png](assets/img_20.png)
4. Generate a public/private key pair in the client machine by using the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/aws_ssh -C ubuntu
```

Note: `aws_ssh` is your private key file name and `ubuntu` is your username of the machine.
![img_21.png](assets/img_21.png)
5. When the key is generated, open the public key file by using the following command, then copy the key:

```
cat ~/.ssh/aws_ssh.pub
```

Note: `aws_ssh.pub` is your public key file name.
![img_22.png](assets/img_22.png)

6. Copy the public key file text to paste that in the server's `authorized_keys` file:

```
cd ~/.ssh
sudo nano authorized_keys
   ```
![img_23.png](assets/img_23.png)
7. Just paste the keys in the server machine that you copied from the client machine previously.
![img_24.png](assets/img_24.png)
8. Then give permissions to the `aws_ssh` private key by using the below-mentioned command:
    ```
    sudo chmod 600 aws_ssh
    ```
![img_25.png](assets/img_25.png)
9. Then navigate to the client machine and access the server by putting the following command in the client machine:
```
ssh -i /home/ubuntu/.ssh/aws_ssh ubuntu@ssh.devopstest.elasticsuite.com
```
![img_26.png](assets/img_26.png)
10. Copy the URL from the terminal and paste it into a browser and authenticate yourself as configured in the policy.
![img_27.png](assets/img_27.png)
11. Now put the one-time pin in the field or authenticate with Azure AD IDP.
![img_28.png](assets/img_28.png)
12. Your access has been approved.
![img_29.png](assets/img_29.png)
13. You will automatically have access to the machine by key authentication.

## Conclusion

We have successfully configured zero trust with browser rendering and native terminal method.

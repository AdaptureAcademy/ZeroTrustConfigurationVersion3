## Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration

1. Open the DNS section of your domain upon which you want to configure zero trust.
2. Make sure you have A records pointing towards your origin server.

## Application and Policy Configuration

1. Navigate to the application section and click on the "add an application" button.
2. Select "Self-hosted" under the "add an application" section.
3. Fill the fields under the application configuration section:
    - Fill the field under the Application name with any name of your choice.
    - Choose the session duration under the dropdown menu as required.
    - Fill the section in the Application subdomain with `ssh`.
    - Fill the domain like `devopstest.elasticsuite.com` under the Domain field.
4. After scrolling down, make sure the "Accept all available identity providers" toggle button is on, and then select
   the next button.
5. After performing all steps, now you are in the "add policies" section:
    - In the "add policies" section, put the policy name of your own choice.
    - Select the action as "allow".
    - Navigate to the "configure rules" section.
    - Select the rule under the include section of the selector field. In existing, we have chosen emails ending in
      option to allow company domain email access only.
    - Under the value field, put your SSO email like `@emraldexpo.com`.

## Tunnel Access Through Native Terminal

1. Install `cloudflared` by using the following commands in your client machine:

```
curl -L --output cloudflared.deb https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb &&  
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
   ```

2. After successful installation of `cloudflared`, put the below command in your client machine to open the SSH config
   file with vim editor:

```
vim ~/.ssh/config
   ```

3. Put the following commands in the client machine in the SSH config file and save the file:
```
Host ssh.devopstest.elasticsuite.com
ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/cloudflared access ssh â€“hostname %h
   ```
4. Generate a public/private key pair in the client machine by using the following command:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/aws_ssh -C ubuntu
```
   Note: `aws_ssh` is your private key file name and `ubuntu` is your username of the machine.
5. When the key is generated, open the public key file by using the following command, then copy the key:
```
cat ~/.ssh/aws_ssh.pub
```
Note: `aws_ssh.pub` is your public key file name.
6. Copy the public key file text to paste that in the server's `authorized_keys` file:
```
cd ~/.ssh
sudo nano authorized_keys
   ```
7. Just paste the keys in the server machine that you copied from the client machine previously.
8. Then give permissions to the `aws_ssh` private key by using the below-mentioned command:
    ```
    sudo chmod 600 aws_ssh
    ```
9. Then navigate to the client machine and access the server by putting the following command in the client machine:
   ```
   ssh -i /home/ubuntu/.ssh/aws_ssh ubuntu@ssh.devopstest.elasticsuite.com
    ```
10. Copy the URL from the terminal and paste it into a browser and authenticate yourself as configured in the policy.
11. Now put the one-time pin in the field or authenticate with Azure AD IDP.
12. Your access has been approved.
13. You will automatically have access to the machine by key authentication.

## Conclusion
We have successfully configured zero trust with browser rendering and native terminal method.
